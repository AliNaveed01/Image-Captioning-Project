Images Caption Generation using VGG16 and LSTM
This project focuses on generating captions for images using the VGG16 model and LSTM neural networks. It combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to generate descriptive captions for images.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can analyze images and generate relevant captions describing the content of the images. The project uses the VGG16 model for image feature extraction and LSTM networks for sequence generation. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images and their corresponding captions.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
nltk
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
matplotlib
Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

main.py: The main script that trains the model and generates captions for test images.
data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for data preprocessing, including feature extraction and text cleaning.
model.py: Defines the architecture of the caption generation model.
utils.py: Utility functions for data loading and tokenization.
Pic Captions.txt: Text file containing image captions for training the model.
New Images AI/: Directory containing the images used for training and testing.
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras nltk pillow matplotlib
Preprocess the data:
Update the paths to the image directory and caption text file in the main.py file.
Run the main.py script to extract image features and preprocess the captions.
Train the model:
Adjust the hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, and steps per epoch in the main.py file.
Run the main.py script to train the model using the preprocessed data.
Generate captions:
Update the paths to the trained model and image directory in the main.py file.
Run the main.py script to generate captions for test images.
Results
The performance of the caption generation model can be evaluated using metrics such as BLEU scores. The generated captions can also be visually inspected by running the generate_caption function in the main.py file for specific test images.

Future Improvements
Experiment with different architectures and models for better performance.
Explore advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms and transformer models.
Increase the size of the training dataset for better generalization.
